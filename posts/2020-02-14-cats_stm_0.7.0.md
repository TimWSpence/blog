title: Cats STM 0.7.0
---

Today marks the release of version 0.7.0 of [Cats
STM](https://github.com/TimWSpence/cats-stm) with several significant bug fixes
and improvements to the fairness of retry scheduling.

If you are not familiar with the concept of STM (Software Transactional Memory)
then you should definitely read the wonderful original paper [Beautiful
Concurrency](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beautiful.pdf)
or at least some of the docs for this library :D However, I will endeavour to
give a very brief overview here.

The motivating observation is that the traditional tools for doing concurrent
programming (mutexes, semaphores, etc) do not compose. Given two functions `f: A
=> B` and `g: B => C` each acquiring mutexes, we cannot reason about the locking
behaviour of `f andThen g` in the presence of concurrency (see sections 2.1 and 2.2
of the paper).

The solution to this is the `STM` monad. This is compositional by definition
(indeed, this practically _is_ the definition of a monad) and exposes combinators
such as

```scala
def map[A, B](s: STM[A], f: A => B): STM[B]
def orElse[A](attempt: STM[A], fallback: STM[A]): STM[A]
def check(check: => Boolean): STM[Unit]
```

How do we obtain a value of type `STM[A]` in the first place? These are returned by
the operations defined on `TVar`s (transactional vars):
```scala
def get: STM[A]
def set(a: A): STM[Unit]
def modify(f: A => A): STM[Unit]
```

A value of type `STM[A]` represents a computation that we would like to run
atomically and which should return a value of type `A`. How do we do that?
The clue's in the name!

```scala
def atomically[F[_], A](s: STM[A]): F[A]
```

Why does this return something of type `F[A]` (assume this is `IO[A]` for
simplicity's sake) rather than something of type `A`? The execution of
`atomically` is the point at which we acquire locks and mutate `TVar`s ie
perform side effects and hence must be suspended in `IO`.

Here is a contrived example of what this looks like in practice. We use the
`check` combinator to retry transferring money from Tim and Steve until we have
enough money in Tim's account:

```scala
import cats.effect.{ExitCode, IO, IOApp}
import io.github.timwspence.cats.stm.{TVar, STM}
import scala.concurrent.duration._

object Main extends IOApp {

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = for {
    accountForTim   <- TVar.of[Long](100).commit[IO]
    accountForSteve <- TVar.of[Long](0).commit[IO]
    _               <- printBalances(accountForTim, accountForSteve)
    _               <- giveTimMoreMoney(accountForTim).start
    _               <- transfer(accountForTim, accountForSteve)
    _               <- printBalances(accountForTim, accountForSteve)
  } yield ExitCode.Success

  private def transfer(accountForTim: TVar[Long], accountForSteve: TVar[Long]): IO[Unit] =
    STM.atomically[IO] {
      for {
        balance <- accountForTim.get
        _       <- STM.check(balance > 100)
        _       <- accountForTim.modify(_ - 100)
        _       <- accountForSteve.modify(_ + 100)
      } yield ()
    }

  private def giveTimMoreMoney(accountForTim: TVar[Long]): IO[Unit] = for {
    _ <- IO.sleep(5000.millis)
    _ <- STM.atomically[IO](accountForTim.modify(_ + 1))
  } yield ()

  private def printBalances(accountForTim: TVar[Long], accountForSteve: TVar[Long]): IO[Unit] = for {
    amountForTim   <- accountForTim.get.commit[IO]
    _              <- IO(println(s"Tim: $amountForTim"))
    amountForSteve <- accountForSteve.get.commit[IO]
    _              <- IO(println(s"Steve: $amountForSteve"))
  } yield ()

}
```

## The importance of laws testing

If you've followed cats-stm for a while, you may notice that the [Alternative
instance for STM](https://github.com/TimWSpence/cats-stm/blob/f9ca142d191eac143dbe2b4e0adafd48cae49db6/core/src/main/scala/io/github/timwspence/cats/stm/STM.scala#L119)
has been removed. Upon adding laws testing, I discovered that
it does not satisfy the alternative right-absorption and right-distributivity
laws (and indeed I believe that STM cannot satisfy these laws in its current
formulation). I've therefore downgraded it to a `MonoidK` instance, which can be
lawfully implemented.

If you haven't tried out law-testing before, please do!! It turns out to be
immensely valuable! :D If we are unsure that a type conforms lawfully to a
typeclass then we cannot safely refactor operations of that typeclass on that
type.

## Open source at Permutive

I've been lucky enough to get to write this library as part of my work for
Permutive. Hopefully if you're a Scala developer you will have already noticed
that Permutive is making significant contributions to the open source Scala
community through the work of [Travis Brown](https://github.com/travisbrown).
Hopefully this post has convinced you that we have a wider commitment to open
source and community contribution, both in Scala and (watch this space) Haskell.
Come join us!
