Iâ€™m Tim Spence. I like strongly typed functional programming languages
(primarily Haskell/Scala) and am currently writing Scala for
[ITV](https://www.itv.com/).

Amongst other thing, I am the/a maintainer of the following:

* [Cats STM](https://github.com/TimWSpence/cats-stm) - an STM implementation for Scala
* [Dhallj](https://github.com/travisbrown/dhallj) - a Dhall implementation for the JVM
* [Dhall](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang) - the Dhall language spec
* [Dhall Haskell](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell) - the reference Haskell implementation
